      <article><h4>About Me</h4></article>
      
      <p>My name is Laissa Kethllin, and I am a freshman student in the Interactive Media Design Program at the Algonquin College â€“ North York Campus. I am originally from Brazil, but the world is my home. I have already a degree in Civil Engineer, but <b>I have decided to build my life as a creative.</b></p>
      <p>One of my goals is to have geographical freedom, so I chose to follow a career that allows me to work from anywhere. I intend to develop all my skills in graphic design, photography, web development, filmmaking and entrepreneurship to be a multipotential creator e achieve my geographical freedom. </p>
